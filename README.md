# Create-New-Users

Create users in AD using a PowerShell script.

You must have the right permissions to run the script.

This script will read the users information from a CSV file and create users with the same details.

This script will write a message about every user in the file, in case it was created or already exist.

The CSV file must be the same as the image in the repository.
